## User Story
As a user, I want to search for the year of a vehicle so I can see specifications of the vehicles made that year.



## Acceptance Criteria

<ul>
<li>The page dynamically updates with documentation parsed from a server-side API</li>
<li>I search a year & I am given details of the vehicle</li>
<li>If I refresh the page or wait 20 seconds a new fun fact will appear.</li>
<li>When I load the page, I will be asked to share my location to the map, which can then be used to search for local gas stations.</li>
</ul>

## Description
When this web application loads, the user is met with a clean user interface that has a search bar and a submit button. <br>
The search bar will take in a range of years from 1984-present.<br>
Once the information is submitted, the API-Ninjas is used with JavaScript & dynamic HTML & CSS elements to generate a card. <br>
Each card will include the car's make/model and basic specifications. <br>
<br>
When this web application loads, the user is prompted to share their location. <br>
If the user chooses to share their location, the map wil use geolocation to locate them and mark their location on the map. <br>
*In development* Once the map has your location you can use the search bar to find local businesses.<br>
<br>
When this web application loads, the user is met with a random fun fact about dogs.<br>
