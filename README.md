## User Story
As a user, I want to search for a make and model of a vehicle so I can see specifications & photos of that vehicle.

## Acceptance Criteria
It is done when:

<ul>
<li>The page dynamically updates with documentation parsed from a server-side API</li>
<li>I search a vehicle & I am given details of the vehicle</li>
<li>I search a vehicle & I am given a photo of the vehicle</li>
<li>I search a vehicle & a list is displayed showing the different generations of that make & model</li>
</ul>

## Description
When this web application loads, the user is met with a clean user interface that has a search bar with a set of dropdown menus and a submit button. <br>
The dropdown menus will have options for a car's make, model and year.<br>
Once the information is submitted, the CarQuery API is used with JavaScript & dynamic HTML & CSS elements to generate a card. <br>
The card will include the car's basic specifications along with an image. <br>
The image will be pulled from an image API.
